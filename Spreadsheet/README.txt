1. Comments to Evaluators:

    I spent more time than I anticipated on fixing bugs in assignment 2 and 3, it took me a total of 3.5 hours to do that.
    On this assignment I focused more on writing my tests before implementing the functions. There were still times where I 
    could have written more test cases before I wrote the code for the function. Doing this helped me understand a couple t

2. Assignment Specific Topics:

    Learn to follow (somewhat) complex Requirements and Specifications. 
    Understand object hierarchy (i.e., a string is an object, but so is a formula).
    Method Overloading.
    DRY software.
    Recursions, abstract classes, namespaces, testing, and code coverage.
    Start to define MVC.

5. Examples of Good Software Practice:

    Testing Strategies: On this assignment I focused on writing my test cases before writing the code for a specific function.
    I did get carried away when implementing the SetCellContents methods and could have done a better job at writing more test 
    functions before implementation. Writing the tests prior to the function helped me understand on a deeper level the specific 
    functionality of each function which resulted in the ability to implment them faster. One area I can improve in my test 
    writing is focusing on all of the if statements and ensure I have a test case for each possible outcome. I expect I will 
    improve here on the next assignment. 

    DRY: Don't repeat yourself/your code. On previous assignments there were functions were I repeated code and points were
    deducted. On this assignment I focused on noticing when I wrote similar code an made a helper method. Paying attention to 
    this good software practice helps me keep my methods shorter and more readable because I use descriptive names. 

    Well named, commented, short methods that do a specific job and return a specific result: Having well documented code
    including XML comments, comments throughout the functions, and having descriptive names for data structures and functions
    has always been something that I felt I have been good at. Throughout the last few assignments I have focused on writing more 
    shorter helper methods and giving them specific descriptive names. Working on this assignment and fixing bugs in the 
    previous two assignments have been good practice to include more helper methods. This will be a focus on the future assignments
    so I don't have to go back and do it later.

1. Comments to Evaluators:

    This was a much more difficult assignment, and many of my test were provided from assignment and ownership
    of those test do not belong to me and belong to Jim de St Germain and the University College of Engineering.
    Those test are clearly marked in FormulaTests.cs

    I overestimated the amount of time this assignment would take. I spent more time than the previous
    assignment learning new topics such as Dictionarys and their methods. Overall, really enjoyed this
    assignment and thinking deeply about dependents and dependees
