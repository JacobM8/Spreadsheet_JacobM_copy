6. GitHub Repo and Commit Number

    - *** TODO *** update Please include a short section near the top of the README that indicates the github repository URL as well as the commit number associated with 
    the work you handin to GradeScope.

7. Partnership Information

    - *** TODO *** The name of both you and your partner should of course appear on any code you create, as well as at the top of the README document. 
    Create a short section in the README called Partnership which briefly describes the contributions of each member.  If all code was completed via pair 
    programming, state as much.  If each partner completed (some small) different sections of work, also indicated this (see Branching below). 

8. Branching
    
    - *** TODO *** Detail any branches that were made so that each partner could work on separate functionality.  Describe the merge process and any challenges involved in it.  
    Make sure to list the commit numbers. 

9. Additional Features and Design Decisions
 
    - *** TODO *** In clear prose, describe to the TAs the list of design choices you made as well as your added features.  This should include how to utilize the features.

10. Best (Team) Practices

    -*** TODO *** If you worked in a partnership, write two paragraphs.  The first should list one or two examples where the partnership was most effective.  What did you do 
    right and how did it make the coding process faster, and the code better? Include details on how assigning tasks helped. The second paragraph should be about an area of 
    teamwork that you need to improve upon.
